#hackathonRepository2024Dec

Welcome, this is the README.md for my hackathon project.

I wanted to make a text based game that would run in the terminal. 
I programmed it in python, and used sqlite to create a database.

The game is composed of modules: 

FEATURES:
    includes common functions
    the basic game loop

LEVELS:
    contains the different days of the game 
    basically tracks the users progress through the sequence of algorithms that compose the game

MINIGAMES:
    due to technical issues i found myself quite unprepared. because of time constraints i decided to integrate programming projects i would learn for this hackathon game specifically so that i would at least be familiar with the material for the assignments that still need to be handed in.
    I also wanted to have a way to really utilize the database and the minigames add a layer to that as do the daily 'rock paper scissors' 
    They also add a layer of interactivity with the game and make it a little less just like reading a short story

LOAD.TXT:
    this is a file that will be created after the user has played the game AT LEAST ONCE. this files is updated depending on where the player has progressed and will be accessed from the 'menu' via the LOAD option.
    Will display information about what level they are on, what the suave rating is, and the name. 
    Wanted to keep the information shown at loading minimum because the information can be checked in game
    Planning on adding a menu system that can be accessed mid game to see scores OR have the information from the minigames and databases be displayed when they are specifically relevant.

GAMEDATA:
    stores information on high scores
    progression
